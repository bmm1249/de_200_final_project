# de_200_final_project

Welcome to our DE 200 final project GitHub repository. Contained in this repository you will find our code for analysis as well as our datasets. We performed our analysis in a Jupyter Notebook so we have included the .ipynb file as well as a .py file which is functionally equivalent. Our datasets are all in .csv form.
